Cook Bacon until crispy but not burnt, crumble and add to crock pot. Save bacon grease for veggies.

Remove the seeds from the peppers. Dice the onion, pablano, and red peppers into large chunks (1 inch). Cook in bacon grease until semi soft. You want to release some of the water, but you dont want them mushy. Strain really well, and add to crock pot.

Puree whole can of Chipotle peppers with their sauce. In a bowl, mix together: beer, chipotle peppers, chili powder, worcestershire, garlic, paprika, liquid smoke, oregano, basil, hot sauce, and cumin. This should make a pretty thick mixture, put every last drop of this spicy goodness in the crockpot.

Stir all ingredients in the crock pot. Stroke beard and say things like: "mmmmm, CHILI...".

Cook on low for 2-3 hours. Stir occasionally. Finish off open beer.

**Wash your nasty hands before you dip your dirty finger in the pot**
